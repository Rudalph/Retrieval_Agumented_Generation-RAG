# **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**

### *Project Summary — Innovative & Engaging Overview*

---

## 🚀 **Project: Retrieval Augmented Generation**

This project was specially developed for my **Faculty Development Program (FDP)** session at **Fr Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering**. Designed with clarity and innovation, it aimed to provide a complete understanding of how modern AI systems combine external knowledge with LLMs to produce accurate and dynamic responses.

## 🎯 **Session Structure**

The FDP session was thoughtfully divided into **two major parts**:

### **1️⃣ Core Concepts of RAG**

A deep dive into the foundational ideas that power Retrieval Augmented Generation.

* What is RAG?
* Why do we need Retrieval?
* Embeddings, vectors & vector databases
* Chunking strategies & context windows
* RAG vs traditional LLMs
* Strengths & limitations of RAG

### **2️⃣ Practical Implementation of a RAG Pipeline**

A hands-on walkthrough of building a fully functional RAG system.

* Designing the pipeline
* Creating embeddings
* Storing & retrieving context
* Query processing
* LLM response generation
* Live demonstration & examples

## 🙌 **Speaker Note**

As the speaker for this session, I was truly excited to explore and present the multifaceted world of RAG. Preparing for this session allowed me to dive deeper into cutting-edge techniques that bridge the gap between knowledge and intelligence.

I am sincerely **thankful to Fr Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering** for this wonderful opportunity and platform to share, collaborate, and contribute.
